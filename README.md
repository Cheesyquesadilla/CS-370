# CS-370

For this project we were tasked with teaching a pirate agent to solve the maze and reach the treasure. We were specifcally tasked with creating the code for the deep Q-learning implementation. The rest of the code and two other python files were provided to us. 

Computer scientists utilize software and hardware to solve problems in multiple different fields. This is very beneficial to the research and progression of different fields such as business, science, and society as a whole. I try to take on the position of a computer scientist in my work by taking the time to understand the problem like they would and find different ways to solve it. When taking up the mantel of a computer scientist it is important to think about the ethical responsibilites one would have to end users and the organization. This means protecting privacy and intellectual property, maintaining the integrity of the program, and doing everything in my power to avoid doing harm in any way.
